# Coursera_Capstone - Collision DataSet

## Business Understanding
The purpose of this project is to develop an algorithm that will predict the severity of a car collision by factoring in various attributes.

Some of the key attributes that are associated with the severity of accidents are weather, road conditions and Light Condition.

This model will alert the drivers when any of these conditions are above danger limit.
