# Coursera_Capstone - Collision DataSet

## Business Understanding
The purpose of this project is to develop an algorithm that will predict the severity of a car collision by factoring in various attributes.

Some of the key attributes that are associated with the severity of accidents are weather, road conditions and Light Condition.

This model will alert the drivers when any of these conditions are above danger limit.  


## Data Understanding
"SEVERITYCODE" is the is the target variable. It is the attribute that corresponds to the severity of the collision. The code values can be the following:
* 3 - Fatality
* 2b - Serious Injury
* 2 - Injury
* 1 - Prop damage
* 0 - Unknown

Attributes that will contribute to the severity of the accidents are
* "WEATHER" - A description of the weather conditions during the time of the collision
* "ROADCOND" - The condition of the road during the collision
* "LIGHTCOND" - The light conditions during the collision
